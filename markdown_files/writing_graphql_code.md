## Building queries in graphql

### Using node, apollo-server and graphql
1. Define initial query called type Query to define all the requests.
2. Add typedefs (define the queries and types and inputs) (usually in schema folder)
3. Add resolvers (they fetch data from database)

### enums in graphql
 - enums are used to validate the data
 - enum types are capital letters as best practice.
